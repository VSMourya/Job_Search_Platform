# Job Search Platform Schema Documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Job Search Platform Project! This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly way for candidates to connect with employers and recruiters in the job market. The schema design represents the backbone of our application, ensuring data integrity and optimizing the relationships between different entities involved in the job search process.

## Schema Overview
The schema is meticulously designed to handle the complexities of a job search application. It consists of several interrelated tables that cater to different facets of the job search process, including user management, job listings, applications, and skills matching.

### Architecture
The database is organized into tables representing different entities:

- `Users`: Manages user login credentials and types.
- `Candidates`: Stores detailed information about job seekers.
- `Recruiters`: Holds data on recruiters using the platform.
- `Employer`: Contains details about companies and organizations.
- `Jobs`: Lists available job positions along with descriptions and related information.
- `JobSkills` and `CandidateSkills`: Manage the skills associated with jobs and candidates respectively.
- `ApplicationsLog`: Tracks the status of job applications.
- `JobRoles` and `Domain`: Auxiliary tables that categorize jobs and skills into various roles and domains.

### Structure
The structure is defined with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data consistency:

- Use of `AUTO_INCREMENT` in primary keys for unique identification.
- `VARCHAR`, `INT`, and `DATE` data types for accommodating textual, numerical, and temporal data.
- `CHECK` constraints for validating data such as age and gender.
- Foreign key relationships to maintain referential integrity between tables.

### Purpose
The purpose of this schema is to:

- Provide a robust framework for storing and retrieving job-related data.
- Facilitate advanced queries for job matching based on skills, experience, and roles.
- Support the application's functionality for job applications, listings, and user management.

## Real-World Application
In the real world, this schema enables a dynamic job search platform where:

- Candidates can find jobs that match their skills and experience.
- Employers can list job openings and find suitable candidates.
- Recruiters can facilitate the hiring process by connecting candidates with employers.
- Users can manage their profiles, apply for jobs, and track application status.

## Tech Stack
To execute this project on a Windows/macOS machine, you will need:

- Version Control: Git

Make sure you have the latest versions installed to ensure compatibility and security.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Set up your MySQL database and import the schema.
4. Configure your environment variables for database access.
5. Run the backend server with `node server.js` (or use nodemon for development).
